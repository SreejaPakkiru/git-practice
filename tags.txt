Working with tags.......
git remote -v
origin  https://github.com/SreejaPakkiru/git-practice.git (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/SreejaPakkiru/git-practice.git (push)
Tags always point to a commit, never to uncommitted changes.

You might see the tag created, but it doesn’t “save” your new file.
PS C:\Users\SreejaPakkiru\git-practice> git push origin main
To https://github.com/SreejaPakkiru/git-practice.git
 ! [rejected]        main -> main (fetch first)
error: failed to push some refs to 'https://github.com/SreejaPakkiru/git-practice.git'
hint: Updates were rejected because the remote contains work that you do not
hint: have locally. This is usually caused by another repository pushing to
hint: the same ref. If you want to integrate the remote changes, use
hint: 'git pull' before pushing again.
hint: See the 'Note about fast-forwards' in 'git push --help' for details.

Reason;Updates were rejected because the remote contains work that you do not have locally.
The remote main branch has commits that your local main branch doesn’t have.

Git is protecting you from overwriting someone else’s work (or even your own previous remote changes).
